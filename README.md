# OnboardingModule
Onboarding Module for Adam app : I created a series of web pages to guide new users through an onboarding process for an app called Adam. HTML was used to build the pages and include elements like text, forms, and links. CSS was applied to style these elements, ensuring the pages look consistent and appealing. For instance, I used HTML to create a form where users can enter their name and date of birth, and CSS to style this form, so itâ€™s easy to read and use.
